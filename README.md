Mattermost is an open source, private cloud, Slack-alternative from [https://mattermost.org](https://mattermost.org).

This service simply integrates Mattermost webapp into WebTop's UI, providing it in a consistent way.

In order to reach a successful integration you need a little configuration on the Web Server on which Mattermost is served. Please follow the [official service documentation](https://www.sonicle.com/docs/webtop5/mattermost.html) to make things work.
